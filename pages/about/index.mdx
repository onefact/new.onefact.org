# About One Fact

Our non-profit structure allows our partners, such as the National Institutes
of Health and Harvard Medical School, to grant access to the health data needed
to build, train, and deploy our AI engine, ClinicalBERT. Releasing andconducting
research using this open source AI means we can require enterprises using our
tech to validate their deployments of our model against state-of-the-art health
equity metrics.

## Projects

[Payless.health](https://payless.health) is a search tool for hospital pricing,
negotiated rates, and health outcomes in the United States, supported by a grant
from Brown Institute (Columbia & Stanford) to parse newly-available but incomplete
hospital pricing data. Payless Health will help citizens and businesses save money
on healthcare and negotiate with providers/insurers.

[ClinicalBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05342) is a healthcare-focused AI
engine developed in a research paper co-created by our founder and collaborators
at Stanford and New York University. It is cited 450+ times and used at multiple
academic medical centers to conduct research, and build novel technology in biomedical
research, life sciences, and pharmaceutical areas.

[Data Thinking](https://datathinking.org) is a set of open-source courses and
industry symposia we're building with our Ivy League and international partners
to increase access to artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science
education around the world, such as the skills to use GPT and other large language
models to accelerate their learning.

[ChildFx](https://childfx.com) is an AI tool to accelerate and support pediatric
radiology, based on a research paper by our founder - Detecting Pediatric Upper
Extremity Fractures With Deep Learning Based Object Detection - that the One Fact
Foundation has worked with Columbia University Medical Center to pilot and test.
