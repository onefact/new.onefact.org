# Support My Mission for Health Equity

Hello, fellow riders. Let me share a fact that has truly transformed my life. It's about finding control over Type 1 Diabetes through a low carb diet.

If you've ever ridden a roller coaster, you know the highs and lows can be exhilarating, but not when it comes to blood sugar levels. I used to be on that ride every day, struggling to find balance.

After investing time in personal research, I discovered a path less traveled by many. A low carb diet.

Now, I experience fewer blood sugar peaks and valleys. It's not about simply surviving, it's about thriving.

Remember, we are not defined by our conditions, but rather how we navigate them. We are riders, after all.
